# Farm2Home 🌾

Farm2Home is a farmer-first, non-profit web platform that enables Indian farmers
to sell seasonal grains (wheat, rice, dal) directly to customers without
middlemen exploitation.

## Problem
Farmers are often forced to sell grains at very low prices to middlemen due to
lack of direct access to buyers, storage pressure, and market compulsion.

## Vision
- Give farmers fair value for their मेहनत
- Provide customers pure, non-adulterated grains
- Build a transparent, respectful system for agriculture trade

## Core Idea
After harvesting, farmers can list their grains on Farm2Home.
Customers can connect directly with farmers and buy grains at fair prices.
